# Authentication System

Backend system having 6 different levels of authentication

## Prerequisites

- Download Node LTS version here: <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>
- Download VSCode from here: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
- Install both before continuing
- Download MongoDB from here <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community> donâ€™t do anything with it just yet.

If you want to use a cloud based solution such as [mLabs](https://mlab.com) that is fine, you just need to replace the `connection string` with the one provided.

## Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayushnanda21/Secrets_Authentication_Security <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> && cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
```

To start your own repository,

> **important:** make sure you are in the cloned directory.

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
```

This will remove the existing git history, and allow you to link it to a new repository.

## .env

Lets create a `.env` file in the root of the project:

```bash
touch .env
```

Then put the following code in that `.env` except you should add your details.

```bash
MONGODB_URL=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
JWT_SECRET=<your_secret_key>
```

## Scripts

```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon src/index.js"
  },
```
## Mongodb
- Open the zip file mongodb came in, for mac users, go to the bin folder and double click mongod to start mongoDB. Windows users look for a similar file and run it.
- Start the web page and server by typing `npm run dev` into terminal.
- The site is now available at <http://0.0.0.0:8080/>


## Running the tests
